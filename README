  comments
    Provides only create and destroy actions.

      gravatar
      card-heading
      default
      actions
		Basically a standard card but with gravatar added.

  comment-collection
    Parameters:
      add-comment:
		The collection of comments being inside a part, can't have a parameter assigned to it.
  
	add-comment
		Parameters:
			form
				heading
				input
				after-submit
				submit
		Does an ajax update of the comment collection by default

	show-page extension
		Paramters:
			comments
				collection-heading
				comment-collection
		Extends **all** show pages.  Only adds tag if the context responds to comments.
  
Example
=======

Include this at the begining of your application.dryml after rapid or auto taglib includes (if present).
<include src="comments" plugin="hobo_plugins_comments" />

Add to the model you want comments on:
  has_many :comments, :as => :commentable

That's it though I strongly suggest adding fragment caching on the comment collection to avoid performance issues on pages with many comments.

Note
====

This plugin requires Hobo (www.hobocentral.net) but is not affiliated with it.  It needs to load after hobo and prefixing it with hobo_plugins both ensures that and implies that hobo is required.
